    If you design and implement data mutation into your tests you will receive 15 bonus points.


Steps
*****

#. First use the excel template provided on blackboard to perform analysis on the code/tests you created last week (mark as Stage 1)
#. Now pull in my updated code and requirements from Lab4 branch on https://github.com/kimballj/cst236
#. Execute tests and make necessary changes to fix them (Do not test new requirements just old ones)
#. Perform analysis again (Mark as Stage 2). Hint: You will need to use your trace plugin for this
#. Add tests for new requirements (> #0021)
#. Perform analysis again (mark as Stage 3).
#. Add requirements / tests to achieve 100% coverage (don't fix any bugs, just document them)
#. Perform analysis one final time (mark as Final Stage)

Lab Writeup
***********

#. What observations did you make while performing the analysis on the system?
#. What are the advantages/disadvantages of performing this analysis
#. What are the advantages of data mutation? Did you use any of these tools?
#. What did you use Mock for in this lab?
#. How long did this lab take to complete?

Submission
**********

Submit excel spreadsheet through blackboard. Bug reports should be included in excel as a separate sheet.

Include links to your git repo and drone.io in the comments. **I will not accept work that doesn't include these links.**

Lab write ups can be RST or a separate page in excel document. **no other format for the write up will be accepted**
