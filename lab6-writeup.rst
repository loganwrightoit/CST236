CST 236 Lab 6 Write-Up
----------------------

#. What are the advantages and disadvantages of manual testing?

    Manual testing is advantageous for verifying test results where instrumental tests are difficult or impossible to implement.
    The disadvantage is that the tests are much slower than automated tests, and are prone to human error.

#. What are the advantages and disadvantages of automated testing?

    Automated testing allows you to programmatically, and quickly, test features of a GUI application.
    Because the tests rely on being able to identify GUI controls, automated tests are more susceptible to breaking with minor UI changes.

#. What new bugs did you encounter with the new code?

    The "Answer: " label had a space at the end that needed to be accounted for.
    Apart from that, the tests all passed.

#. How many UI tests did you generate? How did you deteremine you had written enough?

    I began with one test per requirement.  When I encountered a requirement that naturally flowed with another, I combined the tests.
    I generated a total of 8 tests for 11 requirements.  Because it's requirements-based testing, the tests should fully satisfy the requirements.

#. How long did this lab take to accomplish?

    5 hours.
