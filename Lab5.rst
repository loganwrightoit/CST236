Welcome to CST 236 Lab 5
------------------------

In this weeks lab you will be building performance tests for 6 new requirements and then adding 4 new answers of your choice. 
Three of the new answers should use threading and the fourth should involve hard drive access.

You will be developing your own performance requirements for the new answers you add. 

.. note::

    Confidence Spreadsheet is not required for this lab. However the drone.io job is.

Steps
*****

#. Pull in the latest code and requirements
#. Verify tests execute properly
#. Add performance tests for additional requirements
#. Add four new answers (3 must be thread based, the fourth involves harddrive access)
#. Add new performance requirements for functionality
#. Ensure tests all pass and work on drone.io
#. For 5 of the performance tests output performance numbers in some format (CSV might be easiest to graph)

.. note:: 

    When developing tests you must consider all the concepts we discussed during lecture and demonstrate you understand
    how to use them.
    Load Testing
    Stress Testing
    Endurance Testing
    Spike Testing
    Configuration Testing
    Isolation Testing
    

Analysis Questions
******************

#. What was the hardest part of this lab?
#. What is the difference between performance testing and performance measurement?
#. What new bugs did you encounter with the new code?
#. Did you mock anything to speed up performance testing? Do you see any issues with this?
#. Generate at least 5 performance measurement value sets and graphs (these sets must be worthwhile)
#. Explain Load Testing, stress testing, endurance testing, spike testing configuration testing and isolation testing. How did you implement each of these?
#. How long did this lab take to accomplish?
